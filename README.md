# Simple Agentic Flow

This repo is for implementing a simple library for agentic flow, using only Python and API endpoints.

## Why?

There seem to be so many libraries offering functionality for designing complex LLM-based applications (LangChain being the prototypical example). However, I'm yet to come across a use-case for myself where it seems worthwhile to invest the time learning any of these, if simple Python function-calling would suffice.

This library lets me build my own implementation, for use in other projects.

## How to use

All the files in the `examples` folder should run. Just remember to add the necessary API keys to a `.env` file placed in the root of the folder (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...`).
